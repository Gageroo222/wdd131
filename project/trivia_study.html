                <h3>The Beginning:</h3>
                <p>When first learning how to create websites, you need to learn how to fill your content into a webpage. The programming language that we are taught to use to fill this content is HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Then we are taught the second language, CSS. this is the language that creates the styling and visual design for a website. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>

                <h3>Uploading:</h3>
                <p>Once we have created our first website, we need somewhere to hold our website, or post it online, there are a number of different applications or hosts that will accomplish this, but the one we are asked to use in WDD 130 and 131 is GitHub. GitHub is essentially a host, in which you can import/save your website programming into a repository, from which it can post your website online to where people can see and use your website from any device.</p>

                <h3>Error Detecting:</h3>
                <p>Once we have our website created, we are able to use the live server option in Visual Studio Code to view our webpage. While this live server is open, we are able to adjust our website and view those changes in real time. One tool that we were asked to download and use is an extension for our browser, which is Web Developer tools. This tool allows us to “validate” our HTML and CSS, which essentially will check our programs and show us if there are any errors that may impede with our website’s functionality.</p>

                <h3>Images in HTML:</h3>
                <p>When adding an image into HTML for a website, there are a few small details that are important to add that improve user accessibility. By adding the attribute of “alt” to an image, you can create an alternate text that will appear if the image is unable to load. This is also makes it so that people who use a reader to read the sections of a page will be able to understand what the picture is.</p>

                <h3>Styling in CSS:</h3>
                <p>When styling your webpage with CSS, we are taught to come up with a group of common colors, fonts, and font sizes. When we create this grouping, it is usually the first element that we put into our CSS code, this group is called our “root”, in which we input it into our code is “:root{}”. Typically, in this element, we create a general name, which we use to call a certain color or font etc. to that name. An example of this would be to use “--primary-color: blue;”. Now instead of adding a direct color into our styling, we can call the root function, this allows for more ease of access, especially if we decide to change our colors later on.</p>

                <h3>Color Contrast:</h3>
                <p>Early in our learning in this class, we learned about the color theory and color contrasts. When creating our websites, we are asked to check our contrast on our colors using the inspect element on our browser. When inside the inspect element, navigating to the CSS Overview tab, we are able to “capture screen” and allow the computer to detect and contrast issues for us. When submitting our assignments, we are asked that our color contrast pass at the least the AA level of contrast.</p>

                <h3>User Inputs, Buttons, Radios, Checkboxes, and Text Boxes:</h3>
                <p>Within a website, sometimes you want to get input from site visitors. There are a few different ways we can accomplish this. A checkbox can be used if when you want multiple choices to be chosen, a checkbox is typically a square box, which can be selected, and deselected at will. A text box is quite simple, it is exactly what it sounds like. A small generated text box where a user can type whatever they want. A button is also exactly what it sounds like. A very typical use of a button is a submit button for the end of a quiz etc. A radio button is a bit different. A radio button is a circle, which can be used for example for answer options of a question. A radio will only let a user select one option for each question.</p>

                <h3>HTML Structure:</h3>
                <p>In HTML, there is actually a set structure, it is typically quite simple. At the top of your HTML, you have a “head” element, this element holds all of the important parts of the document that do not necessarily show up on the physical webpage, some examples are the title, description, author, and links to the CSS stylesheets etc. After the head element comes the “header”. Inside the header, you will typically include any navigation links what you want to include at the top of your webpage, as well as a web title and logo etc. After the header, comes the “main” element. This element contains the majority of the page content. Lastly, after the main comes the “footer”, the footer usually holds and copyright information, social media links, and shows the date of last modification.</p>

                <h3>Head Element Structure:</h3>
                <p>When creating your “head” element, there is a common practice structure that we are taught to use. The first element that we usually set is the title of our webpage, this title shows up on the tab at the top of our browser. After the title, the description is typically the next step. The description is a short sentence or so which describes what your website is about. After the description comes the “author” element. This is where you put the webpage authors name, which again, does not show up on the physical webpage, but can be seen behind the scenes, for the purpose of citing etc. After the author element, we have all of the links. These links include a link to a stylesheet, our CSS, as well as links to any JavaScript programs to help with the accessibility of your webpage.</p>

                <h3>GitHub Setup:</h3>
                <p>When first setting up GitHub, we need to create a location to store our documents etc. Inside of GitHub, the option that we have is to create a repository, the repository is the file/location where our files are stored and can be accessed online.</p>
